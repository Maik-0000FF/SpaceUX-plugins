SpaceUX ↔ FreeCAD bridge.

A tiny UNIX-socket server that lets the SpaceUX pie menu read the active
workbench's commands (label + icon) and run a command by name. Started by
InitGui.py at FreeCAD GUI startup.

The accept loop runs on a background thread, but FreeCAD's GUI is
single-threaded — so every GUI access (active workbench, getToolbarItems,
QActions/icons, runCommand) is marshalled onto the Qt main thread via a queued
signal and awaited. Icons are cached per command name (the command set is
stable per workbench).

Protocol — newline-delimited JSON, one request → one response:
  {"op":"ping"}               -> {"ok":true,"version":1}
  {"op":"context"}            -> {"ok":true,"workbench":"<id>","workbenchIcon":"<uri>",
                                  "toolbars":[{"name":"<tb>",
                                    "commands":[{"name","label","icon"[,"members"]}]}]}
  {"op":"catalog","loadAll":<bool>}
                              -> {"ok":true,"loadedAll":<bool>,
                                  "workbenches":[{"key","name","icon",
                                    "toolbars":[{"name","commands":[...]}]}]}
  {"op":"run","name":"<cmd>"} -> {"ok":true} | {"ok":false,"error":"<msg>"}
  {"op":"reserve-button","button":<n>}
                              -> {"ok":true,"reserved":<n>,"previous":<...>}
  {"op":"release-button","button":<n>}
                              -> {"ok":true,"released":<n>,"previous":<...>}

`icon` is a `data:image/png;base64,...` string (or "" when none). `Separator`
entries are dropped. All commands pass — including global `Std_*` (e.g. the View
orientation commands) — so the pie can show them too (#217). The live `context`
additionally drops commands whose QAction is currently *disabled* (no function in
the present FreeCAD state); `catalog` keeps everything (it also reports each
command's `enabled` flag so the editor can offer the same filter when selecting).

`members` (#208) is present when a toolbar item is a command group (a dropdown
button bundling sub-commands, e.g. Part primitives): it carries the member
`{name,label,icon}` entries, a third level for the pie. Members without an
objectName (selection-filter toggles) are skipped; they run via QAction trigger
since they aren't registered Gui.Commands (see _run).

`reserve-button` / `release-button` (#191) clear / restore FreeCAD's own
Spaceball binding for a button while SpaceUX owns it as the pie trigger — see
_reserve_button. The original command is parked in FreeCAD's parameter store, so
the reservation is idempotent and survives a bridge/FreeCAD restart; an atexit
hook hands every still-held button back when FreeCAD closes.
