# SpaceUX FreeCAD plugin

A context-aware SpaceUX pie for FreeCAD: the pie follows the **active
workbench**, showing its toolbars (one branch each) and commands (label +
icon), and runs a command on commit. (#77, Phase D1 — dynamic mode.)

It has two halves that talk over a local UNIX socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/spaceux/freecad.sock`):

- **this plugin** (`manifest.json` + `index.js`), imported into SpaceUX, which
  builds the pie at open time and sends commands to run;
- **the FreeCAD bridge addon** (`freecad/`), which runs inside FreeCAD and
  answers those requests.

## Install

### 1. The FreeCAD bridge addon

Copy the `freecad/` folder of this plugin into FreeCAD's user `Mod/` directory,
renamed to `SpaceUX`.

**Find the right Mod directory** — it is **version-specific**, so don't assume
a fixed path. In FreeCAD's Python console run:

```python
import FreeCAD; print(FreeCAD.getUserAppDataDir())
```

That prints your user data dir, e.g. `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/v1-2/` on
FreeCAD 1.2 (older builds use the unversioned `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/`; a
Flatpak/Snap install differs again). The addon goes in `<that dir>/Mod/SpaceUX`:

```
cp -r freecad/ "<UserAppDataDir>/Mod/SpaceUX"
# e.g. FreeCAD 1.2:
cp -r freecad/ ~/.local/share/FreeCAD/v1-2/Mod/SpaceUX
```

(so you have `…/Mod/SpaceUX/InitGui.py` and `spaceux_bridge.py`). An in-app
installer that resolves this path for you is tracked in #189. Restart FreeCAD.
The Report view should show:

```
SpaceUX bridge listening on /run/user/<uid>/spaceux/freecad.sock
```

The bridge starts automatically on every FreeCAD launch. It runs entirely on
your machine and is only reachable by your user (the socket is `0600`).

### 2. The SpaceUX plugin

In SpaceUX → **Settings → Plugins**, import this plugin's folder, then pick
**FreeCAD** in the active-pie (profile) dropdown.

## Use

Trigger the pie while FreeCAD is open: the active workbench's toolbars appear
as branches; drill into one to see its commands; commit a command to run it.
Switch workbenches in FreeCAD and reopen the pie — it follows the new context.

When FreeCAD is closed (or the addon isn't installed) the pie falls back to a
static placeholder; start FreeCAD and reopen.

### Pie-trigger button (no double-binding)

FreeCAD reads the same SpaceMouse (via spacenavd), so without this the
pie-trigger button would both open the SpaceUX pie **and** fire whatever FreeCAD
bound to it. The trigger button is global (it opens the pie whatever you're
doing), so whenever SpaceUX and FreeCAD both run, SpaceUX clears FreeCAD's own
binding for that button — independent of which pie is active — and restores it
when the trigger button changes or FreeCAD closes. SpaceUX retries on a
heartbeat, so it takes effect as soon as FreeCAD is up (and again after a
restart). The original is parked in FreeCAD's parameter store
(`BaseApp/Spaceux/ReservedButtons`), so it survives a crash/restart and is
recoverable from FreeCAD's preferences if anything ever leaves it cleared.

## Notes

- Global `Std_*` commands and toolbar separators are filtered out, so the pie
  shows the workbench's own tools.
- Icons come live from the installed FreeCAD (no bundling), cached per command.
- AppImage FreeCAD works out of the box. Flatpak/Snap sandbox the socket path,
  so the bridge isn't reachable across the sandbox boundary without extra setup.
- Tested API surface: `Gui.activeWorkbench()`, `Workbench.getToolbarItems()`,
  `Gui.Command.get(name).getInfo()`, command-icon via the matching `QAction`,
  and `Gui.runCommand(name)`.
